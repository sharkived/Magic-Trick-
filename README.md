# ðŸª„ Magic Trick (Beginner Python Project)

Welcome to my first-ever Python project â€” a short and fun **magic trick** using code! ðŸŽ©âœ¨  
This was built as a way to get started with programming and learn the basics of Python.

## ðŸ”® What does it do?

The program performs a simple number trick that surprises the user by "magically" guessing a number they were thinking of. It uses basic math and logic to seem like itâ€™s reading your mind!

## ðŸ§  What I learned

- Taking user input
- Using print statements for interaction
- Working with variables
- Building confidence in Python!

## ðŸš€ How to run it

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Download or clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sharkived/Magic-Trick-.git
   
## ðŸ’¡ Why I made this

Iâ€™m just getting started with programming and wanted to build something fun and interactive â€” and who doesn't love a good magic trick?
